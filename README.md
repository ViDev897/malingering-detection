# Malingering Detection using Agentic AI

## Overview
This project implements an **agentic AI–based system** to detect malingering tendencies using structured questionnaire response data.
The system follows an agent-driven workflow to autonomously preprocess data, evaluate features, perform model inference, and interpret results.

## Problem Statement
Malingering detection is a challenging behavioral analysis problem where individuals may intentionally distort responses.
This project aims to identify deceptive response patterns using machine learning combined with agent-like decision logic.

## Approach
- Structured questionnaire-based input processing
- Agent-driven orchestration of preprocessing, inference, and evaluation
- Supervised machine learning for classification
- Visualization-driven interpretability using Matplotlib

## Key Features
- Agentic decision flow for iterative reasoning
- Feature analysis and classification modeling
- Performance evaluation using standard classification metrics
- Visual insights into data distributions and model behavior

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Notes
This project uses **predefined questionnaire-based features** and does not rely on standardized clinical diagnostic scales.
It is intended for educational and analytical purposes only.
